* Topology Notes

** Introduction
These notes were taken by Kyle Dituro in the Fall semester of 2023 at Tufts University. The course was taught by Sebastian Bozlee at the undergraduate level. The intended textbook for the course is Topology Second Edition by James R. Munkres.

I probably forgot to spell-check most of these documents, and some of them are liable to have blatant errors in them. 

This repo includes LaTeX files, including my personal header file used to typeset these notes. If you have any questions about this header file, I probably can't answer them even though I wrote the damn thing, but I'll sure give it a try. 

The TeX was done in Emacs with some very strange keybinds, so good luck trying to replicate live TeXing notes using this header.
