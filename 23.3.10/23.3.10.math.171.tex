Let's go over part (b) of the early problem...

\begin{prop}
  Let \(X, Y\) be topological spaces, and let \(\mathcal{B}_X, \mathcal{B}_Y\) be bases for the resp. topologies of \(X, Y\), then:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous iff for each \(B \in \mathcal{B}_Y\), \(f\1(B)\) is open.
  \item \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous iff for all \(x \in X\) and basic open neighborhoods \(B_{f(x)}\) of \(f(x)\), there exists \(B_x \in \mathcal{B}_x\) such that \(x \in B_x\) and \(f(B_x) \subseteq B_{f(x)}\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
The proof of (a) is left to the early problem
\begin{proof}[Proof of part b]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item [(\(\Rightarrow\))] Let \(f: X \to Y\) be continuous. Let \(x \in X\), and \(B_{f(x)}\) be a basic open neighborhood of \(f(x)\). Then, since \(f(x) \in B_{f(x)}\), \(x \in f\1(B_{f(x)})\). Since \(f\) is continuous, \(f\1(B_{f(x)})\) is open. By the definition of open in a generated topology, \(\exists B_X \in \mathcal{B}_X\) such that \(x \in B_X\) and \(B_x \subseteq f\1(B_{f(x)})\). Then, using the Galois connection, we get that \(f(B_X) \subseteq B_{f(x)}\).
  \item [(\(\Leftarrow\))] Assume that we have the property, now we want to show that \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous. So let \(U \subseteq Y\) be an open set. Now let \(x \in f\1(U)\) Then \(f(x) \in U\). Since \(U\) is open, there is a basic open neighborhood \(B_{f(x)}\) such that \(f(x) \in B_{f(x)}\) and \(B_{f(x)} \subseteq U\). By assumption, there is a basic open neighborhood \(B_x\) of \(x\) such that \(f(B_x) \subseteq B_{f(x)} \subseteq U\). Then again by the Galois connection, \(B_x \subseteq f\1(U)\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

  Now on to more stuff.

  \begin{df}
    A set \(S\) of subsets of a set \(X\) whose union is all of \(X\) is a \textbf{subbasis for a topology on \(X\)}. The \textbf{topology generated by \(S\)} is the set of unions of finite intersections of elements of \(S\).
  \end{df}

  We claim that in order to show that this is a topology, it is enough to show that the set \(\mathcal{B}\) of finite intersections of elements of \(S\) is a basis. Now let's actually do the check:

  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Let \(x \in X\). Then since \(\bigcup_{T \in S} T = X\), there is an element \(T \in S\) such that \(x \in T\), and thus \(T \in \mathcal{B}\).
    \item Let \(B_1 = T_1 \cap \ldots \cap T_n\), where \(T_i \in S\), and \(B_2 = T\prime_1 \cap \ldots \cap T\prime_m\), where \(T_i\prime \in S\). Now let \(x \in B_1 \cap B_2\). Since \(B_1 \cap B_2\) is a finite intersection of elements of \(S\), it is a basis element, and so we can take \(B_3 = B_1 \cap B_2\).
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{proof}

  So where is this useful? We will now move into a discussion of product spaces. This is where all of the universal property juggling should pay off.

  \begin{ques}
    Given two topological spaces \(X, Y\), what topology ``should'' we put on \(X \times Y\)?

    More generally, given topological spaces \(X_i\) for \(i \in I\), what topology should \(\prod_{i \in I} X_i\) have?
  \end{ques}

  Let's recall the universal property of the product for sets, and amend it for topological spaces.
  \begin{thm}
    Given \sout{sets} {\color{red} topological spaces} \(X, Y\), a \sout{set} {\color{red} topological spaces} \(P\) together with \sout{functions} {\color{red} continuous functions} \(\pi_1: P \to X\) and \(\pi_2: P \to Y\) is said to have the universal property if, for any \sout{set} {\color{red} topological spaces} \(Z\) and \sout{functions} {\color{red} continuous functions} \(f_1: Z \to X\) and \(f_2: Z \to Y\) there exists a unique \sout{function} {\color{red} continuous function} \(f: Z \to P\) such that.

    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        & Z \arrow[dl, "f_1"] \arrow[dr, "f_2"] \arrow[dotted, d, "\exists! f"] & \\
        X & P \arrow[l, "\pi_1"] \arrow[r, "\pi_2"]& Y
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
  \end{thm}
  \begin{prop}
    ``Products are unique up to unique homeomorphism.''
    i.e. Given \((P, \pi_1, \pi_2)\) and \((P\prime, \pi_1\prime, \pi_2\prime)\) with the universal property, there exists a unique homeomorphism \(\phi: P \to P\prime\) such that \(\pi_1 = \pi_1\prime \circ \phi\) and \(\pi_2 = \pi_2\prime \circ \phi\). 
  \end{prop}
  \begin{proof} Let's do some good old-fashioned diagram chasing.
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        & Z \arrow[dl, "\pi_1"] \arrow[dr, "\pi_2"] \arrow[dotted, d, "\exists! \phi"] & \\
        X & P\prime \arrow[l, "\pi_1\prime"] \arrow[r, "\pi_2\prime"]& Y
      \end{tikzcd}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        & Z \arrow[dl] \arrow[dr] \arrow[dotted, d, "\psi"] & \\
        X & P \arrow[l] \arrow[r]& Y
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    Combining these two diagrams, we get:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
        & Z \arrow[dl, "\pi_1"] \arrow[dr, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\psi \circ \phi"] & \\
        X & P \arrow[l, "\pi_1"] \arrow[r, "\pi_2"]& Y
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    So then \(\psi \circ \phi\) is the identity map, and we have what we need.
  \end{proof}
    So we can revise our goal: We now want to find a topology on \(X \times Y\) so that \((X \times Y, \pi_1, \pi_2)\) has the universal property.

    In other words, we want to find a topology on \(X \times Y\) such that \(
    \begin{matrix}
      \pi_1: X \times Y \to X \\ (x, y) \mapsto x
    \end{matrix}
    \) and \(
    \begin{matrix}
      \pi_2: X \times Y \to Y \\ (x, y) \mapsto y
    \end{matrix}
    \) are continuous.

    So we need
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For each \(U \subseteq X\) open, \(\pi_1\1(U) = U \times Y\) is open
    \item For each \(V \subseteq Y\) open, \(\pi_2\1(V) = X \times Y\) is open.
    \end{enumerate}

      \caption{A diagram outlining what our ``Product space'' should look like}
      \label{fig:prodTop}
    \end{figure}
    This is not yet a topology, we still need finite intersections. So, lets add in finite intersections: \(\mathcal{B} = \opn U \times V \stbar U \subseteq X\ \mathrm{open}, V \subseteq Y\ \mathrm{open} \cls\). This in and of itself is still not a topology, but it is a basis.

    \begin{prop}
      Let \(X, Y\) be topological spaces, then the set:
      \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{B} = \opn U \times V \stbar U \subseteq X\ \mathrm{open}, V \subseteq Y\ \mathrm{open} \cls
      \end{align*}
    \end{prop}

    \begin{df}
      The \textbf{product topology on \(X \times Y\)} is the topology generated by the basis \(\mathcal{B}\) above.
    \end{df}

    \begin{exa}
      \(\R^2\) with the usual topology has the product topology from \(\R \times \R\). With the usual topology, we were taking a basis of open balls, but in this construction, we are doing it with open rectangles, which we previously showed was equivalent.
